    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m <strong>[Akshaya Bhandari]</strong>, a student currently
      studying <strong>[BSC.IT]</strong> with a growing passion for web
      development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m learning the fundamentals of <strong>HTML</strong>,
      <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I love bringing
      ideas to life through code. Although Iâ€™m just starting out, Iâ€™ve already
      built a few small projects like a personal portfolio website and a simple
      b'day-invite website, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer, build interactive
      websites, and eventually work on real-world projects that help people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy <strong>[reading, cooking]</strong>, which help
      me stay creative and inspired.
    </p>

    <p>
      ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m always open to connecting with others in tech and learning from the
      community. Feel free to check out my
